    # The boost-range to boost-algorithm module dependency creates an unwanted
    # dependency cycle (which gyp refuses to handle) and is mostly accidental.
    # So WARNING: this URL here does not designate boost-range 1.57.0 but 
    # a successor of it patched for modularization. I hope boost 1.58 will 
    # address the modularization issue satisfactorily.
